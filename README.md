# QBE

Rules:

·         You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a boat and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.

·         The boat receives a character array of commands. Ie f,l,l,r,b

·         Implement commands that moves the boat forward/backward (f,b).

·         Implement commands that turn the boat left/right (l,r).

Display is not important as long as you can enter movement commands… like f,l,r,b   .. and then see an output  1,2

The code should be object orientated and configurable.

Eg 0,0  Facing south…   when f is entered… outputs 0,-1

Eg 0,0  Facing east…   when f is entered… outputs 1,0

Negative positions are ok.

Deliverables should be the java classes to run this.
